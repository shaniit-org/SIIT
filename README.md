# Shan Institute of Information Technology

We're using SvelteKit to make our web applications work really well.
For styling, we've got Tailwind CSS, and for managing content, we're using Sanity.io as our Content Management System (CMS).
If you have any questions or need help, feel free to ask!

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/shaniit-org/SIIT
   cd SIIT
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server:**
   ```
   pnpm run dev
   ```
   This will start the development server. Open [http://localhost:5432](http://localhost:5432) in your browser to see the app.

## Features

- **SvelteKit:** A powerful framework for building web applications with a focus on simplicity and ease of use.

- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.

- **Sanity.io CMS:** A headless CMS that provides a flexible and structured way to manage content. Content models and data are stored in Sanity.io, and the app fetches data from the CMS to dynamically render content.
